# Plans for November

This page details my personal objectives for November 2020. It will be updated as I progress through the month. 

As I write this it has just been announced that the Prime Minister is considering a new "stay at home" order for the month of November. Sounds like another lockdown, which seems very sensible to me.

Reflecting on progress during October I feel it was a pretty mixed. Positives were that I:

* Did a lot of online study to increase my knowledge of accessibility
* Wrote a long, detailed blog post on WAI-ARIA and developed confidence using VoiceOver on both macOS and iOS. 
* Exceeded my guitar practice time goal and submitted a Video Exchange

The negatives were that I: 

* Worked far too many hours - including evenings, during the night and weekends
* Didn't keep up with my health and fitness goals 
* Didn't keep on top of measures to tackle the winter blues. 

I want to do much better in November.

## Health and wellbeing

This is my priority for November. I will:

* ⏱ Limit working time to normal hours, using a timer to stay on top of this
* 🍁 Get out of the house during daylight hours for a minimum of 30 minutes every day
* 🏃🏽‍♂️ Run at least three times each week and do a Sworkit workout on every day that I am not running
* 🙅🏽‍♂️ 📰 Remain in the news bunker, emerging for a maximum of 5 minutes each day and only when there is a need to do so (supported by iOS / macOS screen time)

## Professional development

Good news on this front. My employer have agreed to support me in studying towards gaining a Web Accessibility Specialist certification. I began study towards this last month and will continue during November.

My plans for the month are to: 

* Continue study towards the IAAP WAS certification
* Create a WAS certification learning resource (which will be pubished on this site)

## Guitar

I'm going to continue my guitar journey this month. My goals are to: 

* Submit a Video Exchange
* Exceed 20 hours structured practice during the month
