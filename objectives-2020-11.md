# Plans for November

This page details my personal objectives for November 2020. It will be updated as the month progresses. 

As I write this the Prime Minister is expected to introduce a "stay at home" order for the month of November. Sounds like another lockdown, which seems very sensible to me.

Reflecting on my progress during October I feel it was a pretty mixed period. Positives were that I:

* Did a lot of online study to increase my knowledge of accessibility
* Wrote a long, detailed blog post on WAI-ARIA and developed confidence using VoiceOver on both macOS and iOS. 
* Exceeded my guitar practice time goal and submitted a Video Exchange

The negatives were that I: 

* Worked far too many hours - including evenings, during the night and weekends
* Didn't keep up with my health and fitness goals 
* Didn't keep on top of measures to tackle the winter blues

I want to do much better in November.

## Health and wellbeing

This is my priority for November. I plan to:

* ‚è± Limit working time to normal hours, using a timer to stay on top of this
* üçÅ Do my best to get out of the house during daylight hours for a minimum of half an hour every day
* üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run three times and do three Sworkit workouts each week

## Professional development

Good news on this front. My employer has agreed to support my study towards gaining a Web Accessibility Specialist certification. I began study towards this last month and will continue during November.

My plans for the month are to: 

* Continue study towards the IAAP WAS certification
* Create a WAS certification learning resource (which will be pubished on this site)

## Guitar

I'm going to continue my guitar journey this month. My goals are to: 

* Submit a Video Exchange
* Exceed 20 hours structured practice during the month
