I recently ran a session for developers to introduce them to Flask. Here are the materials from the session: 

* The slides are available in [PDF](/content/introduction-to-flask.pdf) and [Powerpoint](/content/introduction-to-flask.pptx) format
* There is an accompanying [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nationalarchives/flask-101) that allows participants to follow along

It should be quite straightforward to follow along with the slide deck and materials but let me know if you have any problems.
