I was recently asked to prepare some slides for a group of developers on the importance and benefits of good commit messages.

Here are the slides in [PDF](https://15volts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/good_commit_messages.pdf) and [Powerpoint](https://15volts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/good_commit_messages.pptx) formats.
