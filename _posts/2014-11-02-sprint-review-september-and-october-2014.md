As part of my personal development activities I separate the year into six 'sprints' during which I focus my development activity on a small number of identified goals. This post reviews my development activity during September and October 2014.

## Plans for the period

  * Learn AngularJS and create a single-page app
  * Try blogging and screencasting
  * Start attending meetups

## Activity

During the sprint I completed over 60 hours independent study, averaging just over 1 hour each day. In real terms, around 60% of this time was at weekends with the remainder being done in the weekday evenings.

Specific activities completed were:

  * Completing [Pro AngularJS by Martin Freeman](http://15v.co/finished-pro-angularjs-by-martin-freeman/ "Finished Pro AngularJS by Martin Freeman"), a comprehensive text on AngularJS (in retrospect, this was perhaps a little too comprehensive for a first text)
  * Completing the [AngularJS Fundamentals](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angularjs-fundamentals) course from Pluralsight (test score 100%)
  * Completing the [Testing AngularJS From Scratch](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angularjs-fundamentals) course from Pluralsight (test score 100%)
  * Watching the Pluralsight [Play by Play: Learning AngularJS](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/play-by-play-learning-angularjs-ken-cenerelli-john-papa)
  * Completing the [AngularJS Patterns: Clean Code](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/angularjs-patterns-clean-code) course from Pluralsight (test score 87.5%)
  * Attending my first London Web meetup on 'Get Grulping with JavaScript task runners'
  * Reading [The Dip](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dip-extraordinary-benefits-knowing/dp/0749928301) by Seth Godin

## Outcomes

I feel this sprint has been a success, and the learning activity has been worthwhile. At the end of this sprint I:

  * feel I have a pretty good handle on AngularJS. I have added it to my CV and started using it in production. I have also recreated my personal website as an entirely single-page app
  * intend to attend more relevant meetups (but only where they're truly relevant to my interests and development plans)
  * have gained an appreciation for pushing through difficult learning because it provides greatest value (that was really the only valuable lesson for me from The Dip)

## Plans for next sprint

During November, December and January I will be focussing on non-technical personal development. I will be working on my personal website during this period to but I won't be reviewing the sprint here (it's personal stuff to not that anyone reads this). I'll be kicking off the next sprint on **26 January**.
