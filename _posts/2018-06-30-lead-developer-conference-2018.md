This week I was fortunate enough to attend [The Lead Developer London](https://london2018.theleaddeveloper.com) conference. I hadn't been to this conference series before and found it really, _really_ good to mostly because it emphasised people and leadership skills as well as tech. It was _very_ technical in parts (thankfully without too much 'hype') but I think they got the balance about right.

The conference has given me a huge amount to reflect on and explore over the coming year. This will almost certainly result in a few short blog posts as I try to develop my understanding of the material.

Some of the sessions that _really_ stood out for me (given my career stage and the challenges I face) were:

  * _'Go slow to go fast: building strong foundations for leadership'_ by Alicia Liu. This, in particular, is a real gem of a talk (the highlight of the conference for me) which I got so much from. I expect I'll watch this many times once it's available online.
  * _'The hardest scaling challenge of all to yourself'_ by Christian McCarrick.
  * _'Legacy code: big rewrite or progressive rejuvenation'_ by Uberto Barbini. This was a great talk and has, if I'm honest, created a little paradigm shift for me. I'm pretty sure it's made me a better developer.
  * _'The art of giving and receiving code reviews gracefully'_ by Alexandra Hill. I got a lot from this talk that I'll take back.
  * _'Teaching new tricks to how to enhance the skills of experienced developers'_ by Clare Sudbery. So much useful information here.
  * _'Using agile techniques to build a more inclusive team'_ by Kevin Goldsmith

I'd highly recommend watching all of these (when they're available online). You're also welcome to look at my conference notes in either [PDF](/content/lead-developer-2018.pdf) or [HTML](/content/lead-developer-2018.html) form.
