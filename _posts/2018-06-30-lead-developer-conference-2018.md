This week I was fortunate enough to attend [The Lead Developer London](https://london2018.theleaddeveloper.com) conference. I hadn&#8217;t been to this conference series before and found it really, _really_ good &#8211; mostly because it emphasised people and leadership skills as well as tech. It was _very_ technical in parts (thankfully without too much &#8216;hype&#8217;) but I think they got the balance about right.

The conference has given me a huge amount to reflect on and explore over the coming year. This will almost certainly result in a few short blog posts as I try to develop my understanding of the material.

Some of the sessions that _really_ stood out for me (given my career stage and the challenges I face) were:

  * _&#8220;Go slow to go fast: building strong foundations for leadership&#8221;_ by Alicia Liu. This, in particular, is a real gem of a talk (the highlight of the conference for me) which I got so much from. I expect I&#8217;ll watch this many times once it&#8217;s available online.
  * _&#8220;The hardest scaling challenge of all &#8211; yourself&#8221;_ by Christian McCarrick.
  * _&#8220;Legacy code: big rewrite or progressive rejuvenation&#8221;_ by Uberto Barbini. This was a great talk and has, if I&#8217;m honest, created a little paradigm shift for me. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s made me a better developer.
  * _&#8220;The art of giving and receiving code reviews gracefully&#8221;_ by Alexandra Hill. I got a lot from this talk that I&#8217;ll take back.
  * _&#8220;Teaching new tricks &#8211; how to enhance the skills of experienced developers&#8221;_ by Clare Sudbery. So much useful information here.
  * _&#8220;Using agile techniques to build a more inclusive team&#8221;_ by Kevin Goldsmith

I&#8217;d highly recommend watching all of these (when they&#8217;re available online). You&#8217;re also welcome to look at my conference notes in either [PDF](https://15volts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lead_developer_2018.pdf) or [HTML](https://15volts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lead_developer_2018.html) form.
