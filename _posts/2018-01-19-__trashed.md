My evenings this week were spent learning about the new [CSS Grid Layout Module](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/). This post contains my notes (in both [PDF](https://15volts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CSS_Grid.pdf) and PNG format below) and some links to useful resources.<figure id="attachment_1462" style="width: 851px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

### What is CSS Grid?

Grid is a powerful layout system providing for _two-dimensional _layouts (as compared to Flexbox, which was designed for _one-dimensional _layouts &#8211; either as columns or rows). This might sound like a return to table layout but CSS Grid is much, much better (and not just because using tables for layout is terrible &#8211; CSS Grid is much better than anything we&#8217;ve had until now).

### How CSS Grid is different

There are several ways that CSS Grid is significantly better than anything we&#8217;ve had before. Here are a few that really stand out to me:

  * **it&#8217;s an actual two-dimensional layout system** &#8211; and we&#8217;ve never had that before
  * Once you&#8217;ve grasped the basic concepts (which, admittedly, is a bit of a learning curve) **you can produce code that is a lot easier to reason about**. To see an example of this take a look at the CSS for this example of [redefining grid areas within media queries](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/example13/)
  * **it makes it easy to assign content to grid areas independent of source order**. This is a huge improvement over float based layouts &#8211; particularly within media queries &#8211; where document order has a big impact on what can be practically achieved. This alone removes a significant barrier to logically ordered, semantically correct documents

## The most useful learning resources I found

  * By far the most useful resource I&#8217;ve come across is [Grid by Example,](https://gridbyexample.com) a project by Rachel Andrew. This provides everything from tutorials and examples to &#8216;patterns&#8217; (which are &#8216;grab and go&#8217; implementations that include fall backs for older browsers). This is probably all you&#8217;re going to need.
  * Mozilla Developers have created a [CSS Grid Playground](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid). While this arguably isn&#8217;t a _playground_ it does give a pretty good introduction to Grid concepts and walks you through creating a CSS Grid. This also covers the Layout tools in Firefox DevTools
  * [Grid Layout in CSS by Eric A. Meyer](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/grid-layout-in/9781491930205/) is a good reference, but a little overwhelming as a learning resource
