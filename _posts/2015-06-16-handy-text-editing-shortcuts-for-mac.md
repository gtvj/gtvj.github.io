While they're not exactly well documented &#8211; I came across them in the [Mac OS X Productivity Tips for Developers](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/mac-os-x/9781491945476/) course from O'Reilly &#8211; these keyboard shortcuts are very handy (and not just for developers). They'll work across all kinds of applications: Pages, PhpStorm, Sublime Text, browsers, the Terminal. I should point out that they'll sometimes (not often) be overridden by a specific application, which is a bit of a shame, but they work pretty well the platform.

## The shortcuts

### Navigation on a line of text

  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + **<kbd>a</kbd>** **jumps** the cursor to the **beginning** of the line
  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + **<kbd>e</kbd>** **jumps** the cursor to the **end** of the line
  * <kbd>esc</kbd> , **<kbd>b</kbd>** **jumps** the cursor **back one word** 

### Deleting what's on either side of the cursor

  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + **<kbd>u</kbd>** **deletes** from the cursor to the **beginning** of the line
  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + **<kbd>k</kbd>** **deletes** from the cursor to the **end** of the line
  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + **<kbd>w</kbd>** **deletes** the **word** to the left of the cursor (Note: this doesn't seem to work on Safari).

### Transposing letters

  * <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + **<kbd>t</kbd>** **transposes** the two letters around the cursor

Hope these are helpful &#8211; let me know if you know of any others.
