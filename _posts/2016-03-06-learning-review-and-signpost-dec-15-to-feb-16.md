## Plans for this period

At the end of [my last sprint](https://52.27.200.123/learning-review-and-signpost-november-2015/) I described my plans for this period as:

  * &#8216;learning the Rails development stack&#8217;, and
  * getting to grips with my new role at Ministry of Justice Digital.

Well, I&#8217;m pleased to say that I really like my new role and what I&#8217;ve seen of Ruby/Rails development.

## Activity

Some specific activities I&#8217;ve completed (in addition to day-to-day working on the front-end of a Rails app) during this period are:

  * Completing Kevin Skoglund&#8217;s [Ruby on Rails 4 Essential Training](http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html) on Lynda.com
  * Completing Kevin Skoglund&#8217;s [Ruby Essential Training](http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-tutorials/essential-training/47905-2.html) on Lynda.com
  * Reading <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/eloquent-ruby/9780321700308/" target="_blank">Eloquent Ruby</a> &#8211; which, incidentally, has a really good chapter on regular expressions
  * Reading Practical <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/practical-object-oriented-design/9780132930895/" target="_blank">Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a>

### Other useful things I learned / encountered

Having started in a new role I&#8217;ve had quite a lot of new technology and processes to get familiar with. I&#8217;ve had some excellent help, support and guidance from the tech lead on our project who &#8211; like many of the other people I&#8217;ve met in the organisation &#8211; is incredibly capable, motivated and bright. Some of the best new things I&#8217;ve come across are:

  * &#8216;Reverse i search&#8217; for quickly accessing items from your command line history
  * <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" target="_blank">Z Shell</a> which combine to provide several benefits to command line work
  * As someone who has been using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow" target="_blank">Git Flow</a> for a while I&#8217;ve been getting used to <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" target="_blank">GitHub flow</a> and, I must say, I really like working with the &#8216;pull request&#8217; process in a team.
  * I&#8217;ve significantly [improved my commit message discipline](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
  * Written a few blog posts on the [Template Method Pattern](https://52.27.200.123/the-template-method-pattern/), [Regular Expressions](https://52.27.200.123/regular-expression-revision/), [extracting Base64 image data](https://52.27.200.123/extracting-base64-image-data/) and my &#8211; very early &#8211; experiences in [using Vim](https://52.27.200.123/the-road-to-vim/)

## In review

I think this has been a pretty good sprint really. I feel I&#8217;ve learned quite a bit and improved as a developer. There&#8217;s a long way for me to go with the Ruby / Rails stack but I like what I&#8217;ve seen and feel motivated to learn more.

## Plans for next period

I&#8217;m starting my next sprint of 15 March. Should be interesting (Updated 29 April: I&#8217;ve postponed the start of my next Sprint until 6 May. This has been necessary for a number of reasons).
