Since setting out my [new practice routine]({% post_url 2021-02-28-a-new-practice-routine %}) last month things have been going well. **I've managed to follow the principles every day**. 

I'd like to make a few changes, some are to make practice a bit more fun and some informed by the principles I've been reading about in [Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/0674729013/ref=rdr_ext_tmb). I hope to write more about this book in a dedicated post.

The changes are:

* Try to **space out my learning** so that I get a little rusty between sessions (a suggestion from Make It Stick).  This is especially relevant to the limitation exercises I'm using with Solo.
* Do more practice with a **looper** 
* Broader 'following an ear training course' to be more generally about activities around **learning music theory**

<div class="info">
<h2>How I practice</h2>
<p>Each day of practice session will include (a minimum of):</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>5 minutes fretboard knowledge training</strong> using the Solo app in combination with instrument led ear training and limitation exercises</li>
</ul>

<p>Every day will also include:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Some</em> technique</strong> focused on a specific technique (this might be sweep picking, bends - anything really)</li>
    <li><strong><em>Some</em> repertoire</strong></li>
    <li><strong><em>Some</em> theory (although this doesn't have to be while I'm practicing with the guitar)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>If I'm using the Victory AMP</em> I should also <strong>do some looping practice.</strong></p>
