I read this recently and felt there was an important life lesson here:

> “You cannot play with the animal in you without becoming wholly animal, play with falsehood without forfeiting your right to truth, play with cruelty without losing your sensitivity of mind. **He who wants to keep his garden tidy doesn’t reserve a plot for weeds.**”<cite>Stephen R. Covey. “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.”, attributed to Dag Hammarskjöld</cite>

It brought Matthew 18:9 to me and to regardless of a person's perspective with regard to faith to I feel it can be thought of in the context of behaviours which are counterproductive to the vision we are aiming for.

In a very practical sense, imagine you've have a vision for the technical ways of working you would like to see in your team and that includes, say, Test Driven Development. To achieve that vision I feel you'd need to make a real commitment to that way of working going forward, and to address the challenges as they come up to rather than actively brushing them under the carpet and falling back on old ways when they're a challenge. By only half committing we introduce real problems for ourselves going forward. Of course, we sometimes get things wrong but to actively reserve a place for weeds (which in this case would be cowboy coding) is a really bad idea. It is in the nature of weeds to grow, encroach upon and threaten to overtake the good.

And that's quite enough from Master Yoda.
