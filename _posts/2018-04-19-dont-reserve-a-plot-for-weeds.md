I read this recently and felt there was an important life lesson here:

> “You cannot play with the animal in you without becoming wholly animal, play with falsehood without forfeiting your right to truth, play with cruelty without losing your sensitivity of mind. **He who wants to keep his garden tidy doesn’t reserve a plot for weeds.**”<cite>Stephen R. Covey. “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.”, attributed to Dag Hammarskjöld</cite>

It brought Matthew 18:9 to me and &#8211; regardless of a person&#8217;s perspective with regard to faith &#8211; I feel it can be thought of in the context of behaviours which are counterproductive to the vision we are aiming for.

In a very practical sense, imagine you&#8217;ve have a vision for the technical ways of working you would like to see in your team and that includes, say, Test Driven Development. To achieve that vision I feel you&#8217;d need to make a real commitment to that way of working going forward, and to address the challenges as they come up &#8211; rather than actively brushing them under the carpet and falling back on old ways when they&#8217;re a challenge. By only half committing we introduce real problems for ourselves going forward. Of course, we sometimes get things wrong but to actively reserve a place for weeds (which in this case would be cowboy coding) is a really bad idea. It is in the nature of weeds to grow, encroach upon and threaten to overtake the good.

And that&#8217;s quite enough from Master Yoda.
