I've been using my free time each week to learn about [D3 Data Driven Documents](https://d3js.org) and preparing weekly sessions for the developers I work with. The materials I've produced are all on the web, including:

* A high-level [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H8UbPesAFGUxk4IuWzBh3QmIHK1oG55WdYIeGjZ7ezU/edit?usp=sharing) that starts with the basics before progressing through to more advanced topics
* A companion [web site](https://pure-hamlet-59256.herokuapp.com) which goes into greater detail and contains a lot of examples (both in the page and via interactive examples on CodePen). I built this site in Python Flask and all the source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/gtvj/data-visualisation-javascript-with-web-standards). The site is hosted on a free Heroku plan, so might take a few seconds for the first page to load. 

My goal is for _every member of the team_ to feel confident in delivering standards compliant, accessible, dynamic data-driven visualisations by the end of the year.
