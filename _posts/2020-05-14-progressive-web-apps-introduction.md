On 14 May I ran a session introducing Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) to a group of developers. This was a reasonably high-level session and I've scheduled in a follow-up session during which I'll present more detail on the technical implementation.

The slides that I used for this can be downloaded in [PDF](/content/progressive-web-apps-part-1-introduction.pdf) and [PowerPoint](/content/progressive-web-apps-introduction.pptx) format.
