I&#8217;ve always felt that I am (and am perceived as) someone who changes his mind quite a lot, so I find this quote from Malcolm Gladwell a comfort.

> &#8220;I feel I change my mind all the time. And I sort of feel that&#8217;s your responsibility as a person, as a human being â€“ to constantly be updating your positions on as many things as possible. And **if you don&#8217;t contradict yourself on a regular basis, then you&#8217;re not thinking**.&#8221;
