Today I ran a session to introduce developers to the capabilities of Service Workers. I prepared this session to be reasonably involved with several hands-on examples provided through a companion [GitHub repositoriy](https://github.com/gtvj/exploring-pwas) I'd prepared.

The slides that I used for this can be downloaded in [PDF](/content/progressive_web_apps_part_2_service_workers.pdf) and [PowerPoint](/content/progressive_web_apps_part_2_service_workers.pptx) format.
