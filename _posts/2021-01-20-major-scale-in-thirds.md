<blockquote>
<p>While playing the thirds you may notice that some of the thirds are one half step lower than others. For example, in the G major scale, G and B (G-A-B) are two whole steps apart while A and C (A-B-C) are only one and a half steps apart. In music, the distance from G to B is major, while the distance from A to C is minor, which is why the same intervals are called major and minor thirds.</p>
<p>When you play the major scale in thirds, notice that three of the scale degrees have major thirds, while four of them have minor thirds. Specifically, the formula is major-minor-minor-major-minor-minor. <mark>They each have what's called a <strong>perfect 5th</strong>, except for the last one which has a flat 5th</mark></p>

I was initially very confused by the last sentence in this quote. I eventually got to understand it as follows.

A perfect 5th is 3Â½ steps from a given note. This last sentence is essentially saying that, when playing the major scale in thirds every position will have a perfect 5th except for the last one. This last one has a flat 5th because the 5th is 3 steps from the note. This is probably easier to visualise than I'm making it sound.
