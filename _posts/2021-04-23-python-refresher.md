One of my [objectives](/objectives-2021.html) for this year is to improve my skills in the new technology stack being adopted at my workplace. This stack is based in Python. 

I've therefore spent some time doing a bit of a refresher into working with Python as a language (since the last time I worked with it on a project was way back in perhaps 2012). In circumstances like this I tend to go back to basics - just to make sure I'm up to date with the current best practices (and am not relying on any out of date practices). 

Having done a bit of research I decided to use the [Python for Everybody Bootcamp](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/python-for-everybody/9781800562196/) to structure my learning because it has _beginner_, _intermediate_, and _advanced_ modules. I also used the resources on O'Reilly to supplement study of additional material). 

As usual, I'm sharing [my notes](/content/python-refresher-2021.pdf) here so if they might by useful for others.
