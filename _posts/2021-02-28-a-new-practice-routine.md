I put the practice hours in and keep them focussed, but I always wonder if my efforts could be more effective. Recently I've been watching a lot of Rick Beato and Tom Quayle and have decided to design a new practice routine based around their advice.

<blockquote>
<p>I like to think of practicing in thirds... you should always divide your practicing time into: <strong>ear training</strong>, <strong>technique</strong> and <strong>repertoire</strong></p>
<cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=62&v=UMH8CvYQZUU&feature=youtu.be">Rich Beato: the SECRET to Efficient Practicing</a></cite>
</blockquote>

For me, there's something else I feel I need to think about: fretboard knowledge. This is where Tom Quayle's advice (and the Solo app) come in, specifically: instrument led ear training and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=537&v=iCF7RMt60aM&feature=youtu.be">limitation exercises</a>

So here's the plan. From today I'm going to follow this advice. Here's how: 

<div class="info">
<h2>How I practice</h2>
<p>I'll start each practice session with (a minimum of):</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>5 minutes ear training</strong> - following an ear training course</li>
    <li><strong>5 minutes fretboard knowledge training</strong> using the Solo app in combination with instrument led ear training and limitation exercises</li>
</ul>

<p>Every practice session will also include both:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Some</em> technique</strong> focused on a specific technique (this might be sweep picking, bends - anything really)</li>
    <li><strong><em>Some</em> repertoire</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>


## Setting up a days counter

To support this I've set up a days since counter on my phone.

Let's see how this goes ðŸ˜ƒ
