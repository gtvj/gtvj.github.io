I read this yesterday and thought it was an excellent and easy to remember way of guiding our actions. Everything I've learned during my life suggests these are excellent assumptions to live by. Of course, everyone falls short of these to no matter how well intentioned. As of today I'll be doing my very best to live by them.

> I have also found that by making four simple assumptions in our lives we can immediately begin leading a more balanced, integrated, powerful life. They are simple to one for each part of our nature to but I promise you that if you do them consistently, you will find a new wellspring of strength and integrity to draw on when you need it most.

>   1. For the **body** to assume you've had a hear attack; now live accordingly.
>   2.  For the **mind **to assume the half-life of your profession is two years; now prepare accordingly.
>   3. For the **heart **to assume everything you say about another, they can overhear; now speak accordingly.
>   4. For the **spirit** to assume you have a one-on-one visit with your Creator every quarter; now live accordingly.
