I read this yesterday and thought it was an excellent and easy to remember way of guiding our actions. Everything I&#8217;ve learned during my life suggests these are excellent assumptions to live by. Of course, everyone falls short of these &#8211; no matter how well intentioned. As of today I&#8217;ll be doing my very best to live by them.

> I have also found that by making four simple assumptions in our lives we can immediately begin leading a more balanced, integrated, powerful life. They are simple &#8211; one for each part of our nature &#8211; but I promise you that if you do them consistently, you will find a new wellspring of strength and integrity to draw on when you need it most.

>   1. For the **body** &#8211; assume you&#8217;ve had a hear attack; now live accordingly.
>   2.  For the **mind **&#8211; assume the half-life of your profession is two years; now prepare accordingly.
>   3. For the **heart **&#8211; assume everything you say about another, they can overhear; now speak accordingly.
>   4. For the **spirit** &#8211; assume you have a one-on-one visit with your Creator every quarter; now live accordingly.
