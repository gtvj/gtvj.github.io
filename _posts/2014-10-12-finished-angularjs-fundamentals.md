I&#8217;ve just finished AngularJS Fundamentals from Pluralsight. This is the second source I&#8217;ve completed in my goal to become competent in AngularJS development (the first was Martin Freeman&#8217;s book Pro AngularJS, which I described in an [earlier post](http://15v.co/finished-pro-angularjs-by-martin-freeman/ "Finished Pro AngularJS by Martin Freeman")).

## How long it took

The course is delivered in 6.5 hours of video, and it took me 18.5 hours study over 3 weeks to complete. In retrospect, I&#8217;d estimate that 3-to-1 is a pretty acceptable ratio for a video course because it includes all the time spent:

  * Downloading files and setting up a local development environment
  * Following along with exercises
  * Reviewing fragments if the concept wasn&#8217;t understood on the first pass
  * Cross-referencing with other learning materials and the AngularJS documentation

## What I got out of it

This course is pretty good, and they cover many of the core concepts of AngularJS. As you&#8217;d expect, most of the material for this course was covered by Martin Freeman&#8217;s book, albeit from different angles. That was no bad thing for me because seeing something in use across several different scenarios can help me understand it. That was probably the most useful aspect of doing this course for me.

**I passed the course assessment** getting 70% on my first attempt and 100% on the second.

## What were the problems?

Before I get into these, I want to reiterate that this is a pretty good course and the tutors achieve a great deal in the time available.

That said, I did encounter some problems:

  * **There were problems setting up the Node server**. This was quite frustrating and I had to stop myself from disengaging from the course because of it. It also made many of the practice exercises too problematic to attempt.
  * **There were points I found myself confused by the pace and lack of explanation** &#8211; and I&#8217;ve already read an entire textbook on the subject. I imagine this would be worse for someone who was entirely new to the subject.
  * **The module on Testing Angular was complex and confusing**. This wasn&#8217;t helped by the references to modules in the [Testing Clientside JavaScript](http://15v.co/finished-pro-angularjs-by-martin-freeman/) Pluralsight course which, when watched, referred to other modules within that course. I found the whole module quite baffling at times, and to be perfectly honest, pretty much skipped the section on End-to-End testing (20 mins, or so) because he may as well have been speaking another language.

Having now completed a course and read a textbook on AngularJS, I&#8217;ve come to the view that testing AngularJS is a complicated, fiddly and inconsistent business. I can see why it&#8217;s complicated, but it does seem like something which would benefit from a course on its own. With that in mind, my next AngularJS project will start on a test-driven basis so that I can tackle these issues piecemeal (rather than looking at my existing AngularJS single-page-app and thinking, &#8216;Now, let&#8217;s get the unit tests in place?&#8217;).

## Was this time well spent?

Yes. I think it mostly was. I spent about the right amount of time on the valuable areas, and was right not to get bogged down in those areas that I wouldn&#8217;t have retained anyway.

I find it quite hard to skip sections of a course, and have a tendency to be self-critical if I haven&#8217;t understood everything covered. I need to keep working on that because I want to get a lot more efficient in learning &#8211; I feel I&#8217;ve lost too great a proportion of my study time to low-value learning.

## What I&#8217;ll do differently next time

One thing I didn&#8217;t do during this course was to take notes. This was partly intentional, and partly because it&#8217;s not so easy when it&#8217;s a hands-on video course. I&#8217;m going to try and find a way to take &#8216;light touch&#8217; notes for my next course. I&#8217;m thinking of going back to [XMind](http://www.xmind.net), since this will allow me to share my notes in a way that might be useful to others.

## Next steps

I&#8217;m going to take a short break &#8211; perhaps ten days or so &#8211; from structured study of AngularJS. I will continue working on my single-page-app during this time, to improve my hands-on experience.

During this period I&#8217;m going to read [The Dip: The extraordinary benefits of knowing when to quit and when to stick](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dip-extraordinary-benefits-knowing/dp/0749928301) by Seth Godin. I&#8217;m doing this because one of the biggest challenges I face in personal development at the moment is not &#8216;doing the right things&#8217; but &#8216;doing things right&#8217;. The biggest problem in this regard is feeling that I need to cover everything in detail, which can be less productive. I&#8217;m hoping Godin&#8217;s book will help with that. I&#8217;ll write a post describing my experience of it.
