As part of the product I'm currently working on I was recently tasked with conducting a spike on _'the potential for OCR technologies to enhance metadata, particularly for the purposes of search'_. While I'm by no means an expert in OCR it was an interesting exercise which involved: 

* Building a little proof of concept using [**Tesseract.js**](http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com) (a pure JavaScript port of the [Tesseract OCR engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)) alongside **Node.js**, **Express**, **Mongo** and **Pug.js**. This can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gtvj/tesseract-results-frontend)
* Doing a few experiments with the **Google Cloud Vision API**.

This was a really interesting experience and I'm pleasantly surprised by the results. 

Here are my 'show and tell' slides in [PDF](/content/ocr.pdf) and [PowerPoint](/content/ocr.pptx) format.
