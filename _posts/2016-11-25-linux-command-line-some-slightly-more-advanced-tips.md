In my [Mac OSX Command Line Essentials](http://15volts.com/mac-os-x-command-line-essentials/) post I describe some basics of command line use. About 90% of what&#8217;s there is equally applicable in Linux. If the command line is entirely new to you I&#8217;d suggest starting there because I&#8217;ll be introducing a few more advanced topics here.

### Contents

  * [man](#man)
  * [chmod](#chmod)
  * [tail](#tail)
  * [locate and find](#locate-and-find)
  * [shutdown](#shutdown)
  * [Assorted cool stuff](#assorted)

### man to read the manual {#man}

The `man` command allows you to see a &#8216;manual&#8217; for a given command but these are often quite unwieldy. Here are a few tips for finding what you need within a man page:

  * `\` to search (either a simple string or regular expression will work)
  * `h` to get help

### chmod to change permissions {#chmod}

`chmod` can be used to alter a fileâ€™s permissions. It can be a little confusion because it provides several forms of command syntax to achieve the same thing. These including octal, binary and &#8211; perhaps easiest to grasp &#8211; the mnemonic form. For users the mnemonic forms are: `u` for user, `g` for group, `o` for other, `a` for all. For permissions it&#8217;s: `r`Â for read, `w` for write and `x` for execute

For example:

  * `chmod a-r foo.txt` removes &#8216;read&#8217; permissions from &#8216;all&#8217;
  * `chmod u+rw foo.txt` adds &#8216;read&#8217; and &#8216;write&#8217; permissions for &#8216;user&#8217;
  * `chmod u+rw -R bar/` adds &#8216;read&#8217; and &#8216;write&#8217; permissions for the &#8216;bar&#8217; directory and its contents recursively

### tail {#tail}

The `tail` command prints the last 10 lines of a file. A lesser known but extremely useful variant is the `-f` option which allows you to keep the file open and print any new lines as they are appended. In addition, you can use the `--retry` option if the file doesn&#8217;t exist.

### locate and find {#locate-and-find}

These two commands can be used to find files but they work in different ways. Simply put: `locate` is easier but `find` is more powerful.

`locate` searches a database of pathnames and returns every name that matches a given substring. For example:

  * `locate .js --count` tells me that there are currently 14,151 pathnames that contain the &#8216;.js&#8217; substring listed in the database on my machine. Without `--count` they&#8217;d all be output
  * `locate --regex ".s?css$"Â ` lists all the pathnames that end with either &#8216;.css&#8217; or &#8216;.scss&#8217;

`find` is better because it _searches a given directory_ and has many powerful options. Rather than describe them I&#8217;ll provide some examples:

  * `find ~` lists everything in my home directory
  * `find ~ -regex '.*\.min\.css$'` lists all &#8216;.min.css&#8217; files in my home directory
  * `find ~ -type f` lists every file (there is also a `d` option)
  * `find ~ -type f -name "*.js" -size +1M | wc -l` tells you how many &#8216;.js&#8217; files are larger than one MB. You can see how something like this might be useful for testing.
  * `find ~ -cmin -4 -type f` will show all files with contents or attributes that were last modified less than 4 minutes ago (there is also a `-mmin` option which looks for content changes only).

This is really just the beginning &#8211; there is lots you can achieve with `find`.

### Shutdown {#shutdown}

One of the things I initially missed when moving from Mac to Linux was the ability within Alfred to quickly shut down or restart a machine.

  * `shutdown -h now` &#8211; will shut down immediately
  * `shutdown -r now` &#8211; will restart immediately

There are other options that can be found on the `man` page.

### Assorted cool stuff {#assorted}

  * `sudo !!` run the last command as root (Note: omitting `sudo` simply runs the last command
  * `Ctrl + x, e` temporarily open Vim to edit the command
  * `Alt + .` place the argument from the last command on the shell

I hope you&#8217;ve found these few tips helpful ðŸ™‚
