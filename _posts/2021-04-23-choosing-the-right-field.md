Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of the best self improvement books I have ever read. When I first read it most of the ideas were new to me but one chapter in particular resonated because it clearly articulates a lesson I'd already learned the hard way.

If I'd learned this lesson much earlier in life - ideally while still at school - I'd have avoided a great deal of unnecessary difficulty. Some people have an intuitive sense of this lesson: I just wasn't one of them. 

## The truth about talent

The chapter is titled "The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don't)" which explains an important truth that I wish I'd been aware of when I began my career.

Many of the examples given use physical traits as examples but to me the real power of this lesson for most of us is building a life that suits are personalities, strengths and interests. 

<blockquote cite="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">
    <p>Our environment determines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. <mark>When our environment changes so do the qualities that determine success.</mark></p>
    <p>This is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental ones as well. I'm smart if you ask me about habits and human behaviour; not so much when it comes to knitting, rocket propulsion or guitar chords. <mark>Competence is highly dependent on context</mark>.</p>
    <p><mark>The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they are also well suited to the task.</mark> And that is why, if you want to be truly great, selecting the right place of focus is critical. &hellip;</p>
    <p>&hellip; The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. <mark>The key is to direct your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your ability.</mark></p>

He goes on to explain how you can decide to design your life around being in contexts in which your strengths are valuable.

<p>Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft.</p>

I think this is excellent advice.
