I've been using some of my free time each week to learn about [D3 Data Driven Documents](https://d3js.org) and prepare weekly sessions for the developers I work with. 

At the outset in February my goal was to take the team from no prior experience with D3 to being confident in the considerations and techniques that are involved in delivering standards compliant, accessible, dynamic data-driven visualisations by the end of the year (in acknowledgement of the scope of D3 and data visualisation as a specialism). 

Over approximately three months - with some disruption related to COVID-19 - I prepared and delivered nine sessions to a group of developers, providing a huge number of practical examples and covering all the basics and getting the team to a point of familiarity where they were equipped to take on a visualisation project as informed professionals.

The materials I've produced are all on the web, including:

* **A high-level slide deck** (available in [PDF](/content/visualisation-with-javaScript.pdf) and [PPT](/content/visualisation-with-javaScript.pptx) format) that starts with the basics before progressing through to more advanced topics
* A **companion [web site](https://pure-hamlet-59256.herokuapp.com)** which goes into greater detail and contains a lot of examples (both in the page and via interactive examples on CodePen). I built this site in Python Flask and all the source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/gtvj/data-visualisation-javascript-with-web-standards). The site is hosted on a free Heroku plan, so might take a few seconds for the first page to load.

I'm posting this material here to keep track of it, and in the hope it might be of some use to others üëç
