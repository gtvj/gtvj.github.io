Accessibility is I thought it might be useful to create (and maintain) a list of resources related to accessible web development.

## Introducing accessibility

  * [Google's Web Fundamentals course on accessibility](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/) provides a good overview of basic accessibility considerations and techniques. It also explains that access impairments may be situational, temporary or permanent to something which is often overlooked by developers.
  * [An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-july-31) does a great job of describing a broad range of circumstances where a user might

## Curated advice

  * The [A11Y project](http://a11yproject.com/) has a lot of useful information across a broad range of accessibility topics as well as a 'pattern' library of pre-coded accessible snippets covering a range of common user interface needs.
  * egghead.io have a [Start Building Accessible Websites Today course](https://egghead.io/courses/start-building-accessible-web-applications-today)

## Newsletters, people etc.

  * There's an [Accessibility Weekly](http://a11yweekly.com/) newsletter

## To be continued&#8230;

This is just a starter. I'll be adding to this as new material comes my way.
