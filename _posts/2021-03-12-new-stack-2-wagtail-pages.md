In Wagtail we define the different **types of page** in our site (our page 'types') as Python classes which inherit from the `Page` model class. This post is intended to be a quick overview/tutorial for developers new to the working with these. 

## Creating a page type: the steps

The docs provide [a walkthrough](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html#a-basic-blog ) for creating a simple page.

1. Run the `startapp` command <sup>(<a href="#startapp">i</a>)</sup> to scaffold out a folder for our app.
    * Add the newly created app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `base.py` (this is simply the filename as a string to the list)
2. **Create a Page model class**
   * add the desired fields to the model
   * add the logic for any constraints related to the page type
   * add any fields we would like exposed to editors to the `content_panels` list
3. Make and run database migrations
4. Create a template file  following the convention expectations set by the page.

<p><strong>This post is going to focus <em>only</em> on Page models.</strong> We'll start from the absolute basics and expand this to reference some more advanced features.</p>
</div>

## A simple Page model class

This really (too) simple page will allow editors to create any number of guides pages. For each page there will be a single field available to editors for the introduction, and editors will be limited to providing ten characters in the name field.
```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

from django.db import models

from wagtail.core.models import Page
from wagtail.admin.edit_handlers import FieldPanel


class Guides(Page):
    introduction = models.CharField(
        max_length=50,
        help_text='Just 50 characters',
        null=True
    )

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('introduction')
    ]
```

Let's look a bit more closely.

Notice that our class inherits (using [standard Python inheritance](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance)) from `Page`, which is imported from `wagtail.core.models.Page`. Additionally, because `Page` itself inherits from the Django `model` **every page type is a Django model**.

<div class="info">
   <h3>What is a Django model?</h3>
   <p>Think of the model as being the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial02/#creating-models">source of truth</a> for your data. In the case of a Wagtail page it is the blueprint for your page type.</p> 
   <p>Each page type will be represented in the database as a separate table with columns to represent the model fields. Each created page will be a row in that table.</p>
   <p>It is possible to use the model to apply constraints on what editors can supply for a given field (either through logic or by specifying the field characteristics).</p>
</div>

As they are Django models, **Pages can use every field type from Django model**.

### Field classes and Field options

You can use any Django model _field class_ in a Wagtail page and pass to these classes any of the Django _field options_ (All of these are described in the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/)). For example, you could: 

* Limit a field to store only short strings by using the `CharField` (class) and passing it the `help_text` (option) so that this information is communicated via the editorial interface - **_the example above does this_**
* Set a field to store boolean values using `BooleanField` (class) and state that it should not be null with `null=False` (option) and provide a default with `default=True`

In addition to the Django field classes, Wagtail provides two of its own `RichTextField` and `StreamField` (both of which are pretty important to Wagtail but we won't get into them here)

### Panel types

To expose a field within the editorial interface you add it to the `content_panels` list. The example above does this by passing the field name to a Wagtail [panel type](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/pages/panels.html) called `FieldPanel()`.

<blockquote cite="https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/pages/panels.html">
Djangoâ€™s field types are automatically recognised and provided with an appropriate widget for input. Just define that field the normal Django way and pass the field name into FieldPanel when defining your panels. Wagtail will take care of the rest.
<cite>Wagtail documentation</cite>
</blockquote>

When passed a field type **`FieldPanel` will ensure an appropriate representation is provided to the editorial interface**. In my experiments I've found that it is really quite smart about this. For example, when experimenting with `BooleanField` I found that `FieldPanel` would determine whether a checkbox or select was appropriate based on whether a `null` value was permitted. 

In addition to `FieldPanel` there are several other [panel types](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/reference/pages/panels.html) provided, including:

* `StreamFieldPanel` (I'll go over StreamField in a future post)
* `SnippetChooserPanel`
* `PageChooserPanel`
* `HelpPanel`
* `DocumentChooserPanel`

## Using Page models to support IA

The Wagtail Page model also has features to support the desired information architecture.

By default, Editors can create any page type as the child of any page. But there are several ways you can limit this. For example, you can:

* whitelist the parent page types (using the `parent_page_types` property) 
* whitelist the child page types (using the `subpage_types` property)

Additionally, if you'd like to limit pages to be created only under the site root, you can do this by stipulating the Root page by passing `wagtailcore.Page` within the `parent_page_types` property.

By passing an empty array to `subpage_types` you can prevent _any_ pages being created under a given page.

You can also - obviously, though potentially confusingly too - allow a page type to be it's own type.

In addition, it is possible to limit the number of times a given page type can be created by using the `max_count` property. For example, if you only wanted there to only ever be a single instance of your `menu` page you would say `max_count = 1` within the page model.
