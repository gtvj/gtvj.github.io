# Plans for 2020

I've given a lot of thought to what I'll be doing in 2020. This is timely because I can sense plates in my life shifting, pressures to move in directions that are detrimental to my life goals and - as a result of the uncertainty of recent years - a drift in the personal discipline of putting first things first. 

## The parameters

This is a 'living list' of the things I'm going to do in 2020.

### 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Family comes first

The most important role in my life is to be the best dad and husband I can be. Work, study and money are far less important. I therefore:
* spend time with both of my children and my wife every single day
* have at least one 'date day' with my wife each month 

#### ... other people are important too

I care about the people I encounter and try my best to be good humoured, supportive, and encouraging.

### 👨🏽‍💻 Work and study

I want to be an absolutely outstanding Software Developer. To this end, in addition to my full time work, I'm:

* 🧭 **Renewing my focus on software development**. This includes asserting that, while I'm more than happy to make a positive and active contribution to the broad range of activities that result in high-quality digital products, my **role** is software development. Other [disciplines](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team) are responsible for branding, design, managing delivery, product management, resource allocation and business analysis.
* 📚 **Studying to improve my technical skills every week and proactively sharing my knowledge**

### 🏃🏽 ‍️Health and fitness

A healthy diet and regular exercise have a huge impact on my mental health and wellbeing. To make the most of this in 2020 I:

- run at least three times each week with the goal of exceeding my record of 503.9 miles in one year
- am sensible and do all that I can to avoid injury (including always warming up and stretching)

### 🌍 Environment

- live in a way that seeks to minimise my impact on the planet
- follow an entirely plant-based lifestyle and do not buy any products derived from animals

### 🏝 Family holiday

We're on a big summer holiday this year. The biggest holiday we've ever had.

### 🎸 Guitar 

I practice guitar every day using the resources on ArtistWorks. This year I'll:
 
* learn twelve songs and submit each of them as a VideoExchange for feedback and refinement.
* exceed the 115 hours of practice I did in 2019
* record all my practice time using the Forest app

-------------------

Oh, and there are things I don't do: 

* I don't engage with the news, politics related YouTube content or television programmes. If something happens that requires me to catch up with current affairs I will spend no more than 5 minutes doing so each day
* I don't engage with social media (Twitter and the like)
