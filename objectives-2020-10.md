# Objectives this month

This page details my personal objectives for 29 September to 31 October 2020. Plans will be updated as I progress through the period. 

The beginning of this period coincides with a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in the country and corresponding efforts by the government to prevent unnecessary harm. At the time of writing our household has spent five of the last nine days in two separate bouts of self isolation as we've awaited test results for our children. 

The days are getting shorter and wetter and colder. I know from experience that it's good to keep on top of things at this time of year to avoid winter blues.  With everything that's going on right now - not just with COVID-19 but with so much of in the world being in some form of crisis - it feels especially important this year.

* Continue progress towards fitness levels I had before my 2018 injury

* 🏋️‍ Start and keep to the Sworkit 'Couch to Fit: 6 week plan'
