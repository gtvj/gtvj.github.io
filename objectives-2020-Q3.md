# Objectives this quarter

This page details my personal objectives for 6 July to 4 October 2020. Plans will be updated as I progress through the period. The beginning of this period coincides with the country beginning to ease lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic after more than 100 days. It's been a strange year.

**Results for this period**: 

* Run regularly and embark on a structured training plan
* Sign up to participate in a race in the next quarter
* Be especially careful to avoid injuring myself (again)
* Eat healthily

## Professional development

<h3>Progress</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Completed the book <strong>"Guitar Theory: Straight Talking Music Theory for Guitarists"</strong>. Excellent book and I think I got a lot from it. One thing is clear though - as the author says: <q>It takes time; you won't learn this stuff quickly, so just enjoy the ride</q></li>
    <li>Completed the book <strong>"Guitar Fretboard: Memorise the Fretboard in less than 24 hours"</strong>. An OK book with some good tips. Provides some useful navigation/orientation tools - but over promises at bit.</li>
    <li>Completed the book <strong>"Guitar Practice Guide: A Practice Guide for Guitarists and other Musicians"</strong>. This is a short book (39 pages) with a lot of useful information in it. It's reminded me of things I'd forgotten and taught me a new thing or two. </li>
</ul>

## Circle of influence, circle of concern

**Objective**   : Stop wasting time and energy on things I cannot influence.

**Results for this period**: 

* Reach a point where I'm no longer at politics related material on Social Media
