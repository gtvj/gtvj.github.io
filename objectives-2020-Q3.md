# Objectives this quarter

This page details my personal objectives for 6 July to 29 September 2020. Plans will be updated as I progress through the period. The beginning of this period coincides with the country beginning to ease lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic after more than 100 days. It's been a strange year. 

## Health and fitness

**Objective**: start getting back to the fitness levels I had before my 2018 injury.

**Results for this period**: 

* Run regularly and embark on a structured training plan
* Be especially careful to avoid injuring myself (again)
* Eat healthily

<div class="progress">
<h3>Progress</h3>
<ul>
    <li>No injuries!</li>
    <li>29 runs. About once every three days. Could have been better</li>
    <li>Eating has been OK, but could have been better</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Guitar

**Objective**: Improve my guitar skills 

**Results for this period**: 
* Complete the book "Guitar Theory: Straight Talking Music Theory for Guitarists"
* Complete the book "Guitar Fretboard: Memorize the Fretboard in Less Than 24 hours"
* Record all practice using Forest App
* Get to grips with using a looper 

<div class="progress">
<h3>Progress</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Recorded all practice using the Forest App</li>
    <li>Very comfortable using a looper (despite not being able to use them before)</li>
    <li>Completed the book <strong>"Guitar Theory: Straight Talking Music Theory for Guitarists"</strong>. Excellent book and I think I got a lot from it. One thing is clear though - as the author says: <q>It takes time; you won't learn this stuff quickly, so just enjoy the ride</q></li>
    <li>Completed the book <strong>"Guitar Fretboard: Memorise the Fretboard in less than 24 hours"</strong>. An OK book with some good tips. Provides some useful navigation/orientation tools - but over promises at bit.</li>
    <li>Completed the book <strong>"Guitar Practice Guide: A Practice Guide for Guitarists and other Musicians"</strong>. This is a short book (39 pages) with a lot of useful information in it. It's reminded me of things I'd forgotten and taught me a new thing or two. </li>
</ul>

## Circle of influence, circle of concern

**Objective**: Stop wasting time and energy on things I cannot influence.

**Results for this period**: 

* Reach a point where I'm no longer at politics related material on Social Media
* Limit news consumption to a maximum of 5 minutes a day (using iOS Screen Time limits to support this)

<div class="progress">
<h3>Progress</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Not much. Still stuck in the old ways. Will address this in the next plan</li>
</ul>
