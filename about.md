I'm a full stack developer from London, England. This page describes my professional purpose, interests and goals. I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gtvjones) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gtvjones/), although I'm not very active on these platforms.

## Why I'm a developer?

As developers we build things countless people use and rely on. 

Such reach is great but it means we have very little knowledge of our users' circumstances or context. Fortunately, web technologies can accommodate huge differences in users' hardware, software, network, context and ability. But this is often overlooked in favour of development fashion, individual interests or convenience. 

This has resulted in much of the web being broken and that _really_ isn't OK. 

I believe developers have a duty to act responsibly and place our organisations' goals and user needs before our personal interests or convenience. That might sound obvious but - in practice - this is a balance even the best intentioned of developers find hard to achieve. 

As a Lead Developer I have significant impact on the day-to-day decisions of many  developers and  can influence their approach as they move forward in their careers. That is a wonderful opportunity and there's nothing I'd rather do.

## What I'm interested in doing

The things that I'm keen to do in my professional life are:

1. Building things that meet real needs and which are accessible and inclusive
2. Learning new skills and seeking to continuously improve working practices
3. Setting high standards for development that work for users, the organisation and individual developers
4. Helping less experienced developers improve their skills, shape their approach and enjoy their work


## How I'd like my professional life to look

### ...in five years?
* To be a trusted technical lead with a significant track record of delivering high-quality, robust, maintainable and extensible services across a range of platforms.
* To be highly skilled in relevant and emerging technologies of the day with a wealth of diverse experience to ensure they are applied judiciously.

### ...in the next two years?

I would like to:

* (still) be a Lead Developer. There's a lot of potential in this role to positively influence: 
    * the productivity and morale of a development team, and; 
    * foster a culture for developers working well with other disciplines. 
* be creatively applying my technical skills on a daily basis by: designing, writing and reviewing code, and; coaching and mentoring developers.
* be working as part of an upbeat, engaged, user-focussed, multi-disciplinary team.
* be building my technical leadership skills through setting development standards and shaping the organisation's approach to development.
* have renewed my 'full stack' development skills. I've been focussed on front end for a few years and - while I do want to continue with this - I'm also very interested in building my 'back end' and cloud infrastructure skills.
* be doing more of the things I'm interested in [(above)](#what-im-interested-in-doing), and none of the things described in the 'What does bad look like?' section [(below)](#what-does-bad-look-like)
* have begun post-graduate study in an area relevant to my work

## What does ‘bad’ look like?

So, that's all good. But I should probably mention the things I have no interest in and/or which I've identified as potentially jeopardising my professional goals.

* **Being a line manager**. I absolutely do not want to return to line management. There are several reasons for this, which I've written about in [what being a manager taught me about myself](/2019/10/30/what-being-a-manager-taught-me-about-myself.html).
* **Slipping into a ‘generalist’ or ‘managerial’ role**. I’m always happy to help with a broad range of things (like admin and other generalist tasks), but I always intend to be a technical specialist first and foremost.
