I'm a web developer from London, England. This page describes my professional purpose, interests and goals. I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gtvjones/), although I'm not at all active on that platform.

## Why I'm a developer?

As developers we build things countless people use and rely on. Many of us can look at the analytics data for our sites and see that millions of people use  them on a regular basis.

Such reach is great but it means we have very little knowledge of our users' circumstances or context. Fortunately, web technologies can accommodate huge differences in users' hardware, software, network, context and ability. But this is often overlooked in favour of development fashion, individual interests or convenience. 

This has resulted in much of the web being broken and that _really_ isn't OK. 

I believe developers have a duty to act responsibly and place our organisations' goals and user needs before our personal interests or convenience. That might sound obvious but - in practice - this is a balance even the best intentioned of developers find hard to achieve. 

As a Lead Developer I have significant impact on the day-to-day decisions of many  developers and  can influence their approach as they move forward in their careers. That is a wonderful opportunity and there's nothing I'd rather do.

## What I'm interested in doing

The things that I'm keen to do in my professional life are:

1. Building things that meet real needs and which are accessible and inclusive
2. Learning new skills and seeking to continuously improve working practices
3. Demonstrating high standards for development that benefit users, my employer and future developers
4. Helping less experienced developers improve their skills, shape their approach and enjoy their work


## How I'd like my professional life to look in two years

I would like to:

* be creatively applying my technical skills on a daily basis by: designing, writing and reviewing code, and; coaching and mentoring developers.
* be working as part of an upbeat, engaged, user-focussed, multi-disciplinary team.
* be building my technical leadership skills through setting development standards and shaping the organisation's approach to development.
* be doing more of the things I'm interested in [(above)](#what-im-interested-in-doing), and none of the things described in the 'What does bad look like?' section [(below)](#what-does-bad-look-like)

## What does ‘bad’ look like?

So, that's all good. But I should probably mention the things I have no interest in and/or which I've identified as potentially jeopardising my professional goals.

* **Being a line manager**. I absolutely do not want to return to line management. There are several reasons for this, which I've written about in [what being a manager taught me about myself](/2019/10/30/what-being-a-manager-taught-me-about-myself.html).
* **Slipping into a ‘generalist’ or ‘managerial’ role**. I’m always happy to help with a broad range of things (like admin and other generalist tasks), but I always intend to be a technical specialist first and foremost.
