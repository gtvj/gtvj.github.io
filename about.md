I'm a web developer from London, England. This page describes my professional purpose, interests and goals. I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gtvjones/), although I'm not at all active on that platform.

## Why I'm a developer?

As developers we build things countless people use and rely on. Many of us can look at the analytics data for our sites and see that millions of people use  them on a regular basis.

Such reach is great but it means we have very little knowledge of our users' circumstances or context. Fortunately, web technologies can accommodate huge differences in users' hardware, software, network, context and ability. But this is often overlooked in favour of development fashion, individual interests or convenience. 

This has resulted in much of the web being broken and that _really_ isn't OK. 

I believe developers have a duty to act responsibly and place our organisations' goals and user needs before our personal interests or convenience. That might sound obvious but - in practice - this is a balance even the best intentioned of developers find hard to achieve. 

As a Lead Developer I have significant impact on the day-to-day decisions of many  developers and  can influence their approach as they move forward in their careers. That is a wonderful opportunity and there's nothing I'd rather do.

## What I'm interested in doing

The things that I'm keen to do in my professional life are:

1. Building things that meet real needs and which are accessible and inclusive
2. Learning new skills and seeking to continuously improve working practices
3. Demonstrating high standards for development that benefit users, my employer and future developers
4. Helping less experienced developers improve their skills, shape their approach and enjoy their work


## How I'd like my professional life to look in two years

I would like to:

* be creatively applying my technical skills on a daily basis by: designing, writing and reviewing code, and; coaching and mentoring developers.
* be working as part of an upbeat, engaged, user-focussed, multi-disciplinary team.
* be building my technical leadership skills through setting development standards and shaping the organisation's approach to development.
* be doing more of the things I'm interested in [(above)](#what-im-interested-in-doing), and none of the things described in the 'What does bad look like?' section [(below)](#what-does-bad-look-like)

## What I'm not a good fit for

I believe we all need to be very cautious of what Jim Collins calls <q>the undisciplined pursuit of more</q> and should instead focus on the disciplined pursuit of <strong>less but better</strong>. The case for this approach is brilliantly explained in [Greg McKeown's Essentialism](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0753555166/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=essentialism&qid=1612699482&sr=8-1):

<p>
If we search for a good career opportunity our brain will serve up scores of pages to explore and work through. Instead, why not conduct an advanced search and ask three question: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>what am I deeply passionate about;</li>
    <li>what taps my talent, and;</li>
    <li>what meets a significant need in the world?</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, there won't be as many pages to view <em>but that is the point of the exercise</em>. We aren't looking for a plethora of good things to do. <strong>We are looking for the one where we can our absolutely highest point of contribution</strong></p>

For me that is being a great software developer devoting their skills and effort to products that serve the public good. The things I have no interest in and/or which I've identified as directly jeopardising my highest contribution are:

* **Being a line manager**. I absolutely (categorically and emphatically) do not want to return to line management. There are several reasons for this, which I've written about in [what being a manager taught me about myself](/2019/10/30/what-being-a-manager-taught-me-about-myself.html).
* **Slipping into a ‘generalist’ or ‘jack of all trades’ role**. I’m always happy to help with a broad range of things (like supporting other speciailisms, admin and other generalist tasks), but I always intend to be a technical specialist first and foremost.
