Container Operator's Manual<ol><li>Talk purpose is to examine containers a little more
critically than we have to date.<ol><li>What is a container?<ol><li>Containers are processes born from
tar balls anchored to namespaces
controlled by croups</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>4 lessons about containers<ol><li>Containers have strengths<ol><li>These strengths lie in ephemeral,
disposable processes (i.e.
stateless applications)<ol><li>This can:<ol><li>Make things portable</li><li>Make things iterable</li><li>Help with disaster recovery</li><li>Help with creating
testing environments</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Containers have weaknesses<ol><li>These lie in things that keep their state
(i.e. a stateful application) - i.e. databases<ol><li>Avoid containerising
databases<ol><li>You can get the benefits that
containerisation provides by
using a cloud solution<ol><li>AG would highly recommend
going witha cloud solution</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>It's never 'just containers' - containers need friends<ol><li>Other components you'll need to think about<ol><li>What will you use to *build*
your container resources</li><li>*Orchestration* - how are you going to
schedule container resources</li><li>*Management* - how will
you manage clusters</li><li>*Networking* - how will you handle
routing, access control, service
discovery</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Containers need headcount -
*you need to hire a brand new
team*<ol><li>*You are going to need to build
a new team* (ideally 6-8 people
but no less than 4). They'll
need specific skills:<ol><li>*Operations* (including ops at
your company - people who know where the
skeletons are buried, where the
snowflakes are running etc.)</li><li>Deployments</li><li>Tooling</li><li>Monitoring</li><li>Kernel engineer</li><li>Networking</li><li>InfoSec</li><li>Internal adoption (someone
who can help with this)</li><li>Project manager</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Dan Persa - First
Steps as a Lead<ol><li>As leaders it's our responsibility to inspire people</li><li>Lessons:<ol><li>*Read the job description* to make sure it fits
your goals. In some companies there will be
less coding, in others more.</li><li>Ask for support</li><li>Be prepared for lots of meetings - but Dan got used to this</li><li>Career switch - the skill-set required to be an
effective lead is not the same as that which is
required to be a successful lead. *The DRY
principle doesn't apply to people*</li><li>Learn fast<ol><li>Get a mentor</li><li>Apply what you read in books</li><li>Think about the way you felt about the
leaders you've worked with</li></ol></li><li>Gain trust rather than trying to exert control<ol><li>And foster a culture of trust<ol><li>Help the team take ownership for their problems</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The feedback look is
much longer.</li><li>As leads we are accountable for both
the decisions we take as well as for the
ones we decide not to take<ol><li>An example here is finding the right
balance of giving people the right level
of constructive feedback</li></ol></li><li>Try to encourage a feedback culture</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Alexandra Hill - "It's personal - The
Art of Giving and Receiving Code
Reviews Gracefully" *(Watch Again!)*<ol><li>Code reviews are good for
functionality, readability,
maintainability and scalability</li><li>Things we can do as an
Organisation, Reviewer and Author<ol><li>As an organisation
we can<ol><li>Pair</li><li>Discuss approach
before implementation</li><li>Not silo codebases</li><li>Ensure everyone reviews and
all code is reviewed</li></ol></li><li>As a reviewer we can <ol><li>Acknowledge that you can raise
code by a grade or two, but you
can't take an 'F' and make it an 'A'</li><li>Use 'we' instead of 'you'</li><li>Ask questions</li><li>Give positive feedback <ol><li>And always say
thank you</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>As an author we can<ol><li>Use the 'Act as if' technique (from CBT)</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Summary<ol><li>Anticipate feelings
of ownership</li><li>Minimize unnecessary conflict so
you can focus on the important ones</li><li>Nudge towards collaboration by
reducing defensiveness</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Pia Nilsson - Knowing Me,

presented
bottlenecks</li><li>Pairing and mob
programming as the
default</li><li>Blockers of flow:<ol><li>"I can't do brainstorming
because I haven't had time to
think on my own first"<ol><li>Psychological safety - a key factor in
building an effective team<ol><li>Action: created 'Creme
Brûlée' - hard of the surface
and soft on the inside<ol><li>Ask the stupid
questions</li><li>Speak about a task - how
it makes you feel</li><li>Trying to be a
little vulnerable</li></ol></li><li>Action: toxic
communications<ol><li>There are four toxic
communication patterns to be
avoided:<ol><li>Criticism, defensiveness,
stonewalling and contempt</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>"I'm interrupted all the time"<ol><li>Needed to practice listening<ol><li>The 'Yes' 'And'
technique</li></ol></li><li>Wait your turn: do not interrupt others</li></ol></li><li>"We think so differently, it's just
better we don't pair together"<ol><li>Find ways of giving
friendly feedback<ol><li>Non-violent
communication:<ol><li>"When ___ (describe action), I
feel ___ (share feeling)
because I have a need for ___
(state need). Would your
consider ___ (share request)</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Turn up the good<ol><li>From Positive Psychology: We're far
more likely to improve our ways of
working if we focus on what is working
rather than trying to find fault.<ol><li>How can we turn up what's
working by one notch</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>"I'm not sure about the purpose of this
team or what I'm doing here"<ol><li>Used Google format of
'Objectives &amp; Key Results'<ol><li>The results do not mention any of the
'how' - just the desired result</li></ol></li><li>Despicable design<ol><li>Start out by defining the
worst possible UX</li><li>This causes you to think
about your users</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Having an effective team is not static
at all - you don't just do it once. It's a
constant process.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Menno van Slooten - How I
learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Meetings<ol><li>Describes himself as a *_'professional
rubber duck'_*</li><li>When I became a lead I had
some ideas of what I was
signing up for, but they were
completely wrong</li><li>The interruptions were so
bad that my interruptions
would be interrupted.<ol><li>I learned to love interruptions -
because there's no better way to
provide value to someone than
by helping them directly with
their work</li></ol></li><li>Chasing the feeling you
get from programming
will stop you from feeling
the value of being a lead
developer</li><li>As a lead developer you
have a significant amount
of influence and power -
*and you can use this to
improve the lives of others*</li><li>If I attend a meeting it usually
means that several others
were not having to</li></ol></li><li>Jenny Duckett - Building

Don't Mean Prizes<ol><li>The people we're producing things for
don't care about stores or points - they
care about the value</li><li>Make 'value' based decisions (i.e. what
value does this provide?)</li><li>Three questions
that can help:<ol><li>Can we take a
story and bin it or do it later</li><li>Can we take a story and

Fast: Building Strong
Foundations for Leadership *(Watch again!)*<ol><li>Being a good leader starts with 'you'

physically and mentally healthy<ol><li>If you don't have a strong foundation
you will eventually burn out</li></ol></li><li>Even when people know what to
do, it's still really hard to actually
do that in your lives</li><li>"I know I wasn't qualified for the job,
because no one is ever qualified for a job -
until you've actually done it"<ol><li>I was, however, the most
qualified, unqualified person</li></ol></li><li>"I've overcome depression successfully, more
than once... *What's so insidious about mental
health - the faculty that you use to detect
problems is is the same thing that is actually broken*"</li><li>I don't actually sleep any more, but the

Code: Big Rewrite or
Progressive Rejuvenation *(Watch again!)*<ol><li>I'm a bit unusual because I kind of like
working with legacy systems</li><li>"We'd like to retire it but ... we
don't know who is using it!"</li><li>When your technical debt get so
high you face to default.</li><li>Further degredation: The
law of broken windows:<ol><li>Once one window of an old building has
been broken, you'll see they've all been
broken within a few weeks.</li></ol></li><li>Hidden costs of rewrite</li><li>The Strangler Pattern</li><li>Code quality is not TDD, design patterns, test
coverage. These are 'tools'. Code quality should be
measured in how quickly new features can be added
and how quickly bugs can be fixed</li><li>Source Code Rejuvenation
is not Refactoring</li></ol></li><li>Crystal Yan - Build a Better Hiring
Process with Design Thinking</li><li>Marek Rogala - Functional
Programming for Everyone<ol><li>FP is one of the ways of writing
code, and, like OO and procedural
it has it's own rules<ol><li>No mutable variables</li><li>No loops (use recursion or map() etc. instead)</li></ol></li><li>Immutability island<ol><li>There is no mutable state and
functions have no side effects</li><li>This makes you design your
programming - code only flows one way</li><li>Code is therefore:<ol><li>Easier to reason about</li><li>Easier to test</li><li>Easier to parallelize</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Declarative desert<ol><li>FP is declarative. We define
'what' rather than the
imperative approach of 'how'</li><li>Declarative
programs are:<ol><li>Easier to understand</li><li>Easier to optmize</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Perspective peak<ol><li>Writing FP is very different, and it
gives you a new perspective on programming</li><li>Functions are
first-class citixens</li><li>Frameworks come and got, but new ways
of thinking are never outdated</li></ol></li><li>How to encourage developers

- How to Enhance the Skills of
Experienced Developers *(Watch again!)*<ol><li>Can you Teach an Old
Dog New Tricks?<ol><li>I'm not being very specific about
what skills I'm teaching</li><li>As a teacher it's part of my job to help
pupils, who are fellow developers,
believe that they can succeed.<ol><li>The things that I'm talking about
are things that I aspire to.</li></ol></li><li>We are all teachers. We are all teaching each other, all the time</li></ol></li><li>Principles<ol><li>No intellectual elitism <ol><li>This is a big problem because it leads to an
elite at the top who talk jargon to each other
who think they are special. Everybody is just
as stupid as I am.</li></ol></li><li>Empathy<ol><li>If you're teaching somebody - what
you want to do is to imagine what if
feels like to be them.</li></ol></li><li>Diversity - neuro,
race, gender, age<ol><li>See people as people. Think
about what their needs are</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Strategies<ol><li>Pairing<ol><li>Are they getting along, is it a difficult
experience, is it going OK?</li><li>When I came back into the industry I
was quite insecure. I deliberately
came in at entry level,</li><li>When you teach someone something there
will be things you forget. When pairing,
everything is in the open.</li><li>I'm eternally grateful to all of
the people who in my career
say 'I'm confused'<ol><li>When you're in a leadership position
it is important that you show people
when you're confused</li><li>How you say this matters: you can say that
you're confused by something without
suggesting that you're stupid</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Workshops<ol><li>The thing about workshops is not to
feel like what you're delivering is a
professional workshop</li><li>We ran one about
async await in C#<ol><li>I brushed up on it (about an hour or so) and I thought
about what an exercise. Gave a quick intro. Divided up
into pairs - have a go at the example</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Group learning<ol><li>(Like a workshop, but less structured -
and with little or no preparation)</li></ol></li><li>Don't overload<ol><li>If you present information in a way that
makes people feel stupid you will put them off</li><li>If you have people who have different
paces, get the person who is faster to
teach someone else.<ol><li>There is no point in having a complex
understanding of something if you
can't teach it to someone<ol><li>If you can't explain your Phd to someone who
who doesn't understand the topic, then you
don't understand it yourself</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Lunch and learns<ol><li>These can be about our hobbies - it
helps foster a culture of learning</li><li>We are going to have to learn new
things - and we need to make this an
explicit part of the culture</li></ol></li><li>Ask questions<ol><li>Because you want to know the answer, because
you want people to know things, because you want
people to understand that there are no such things
as stupid questions</li><li>Nobody knows exactly
what is going on</li></ol></li><li>Mob programming</li><li>Deep Dive<ol><li>Don't praise the knowledge, praise
the thirst of knowledge</li><li>People want you to know when
they did well, and when they
didn't do so well.</li></ol></li><li>Safety and security<ol><li>If you create an environment where developers
feel they can be themselves, you will get much
better results from them.</li></ol></li><li>Highlight good
examples</li><li>Give feedback</li><li>Be open to change<ol><li>Be open to new experiences. Let
others suggest things</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Dirkjan Bussink - Tips for
Managing a Widely
Distributed Team<ol><li>Why would you want a

amazing talent you want for
your team in one place
anymore.</li><li>Do you really want to pay a lot of
money to have everybody living

not eveilable</li><li>Edge cases</li><li>Time-sensitive
changes are needed</li></ol></li><li>Strategies for editing<ol><li>Strategy 1: Develop a Review
Process for Manual Edits<ol><li>They used a Google
Spreadsheet, which let's
people review it before it's run</li><li>This is good because it's
easy to run, and the effects
are really powerful. It also
helps to promote the right
