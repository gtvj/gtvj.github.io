This is a place where I record the things I'm learning about guitar playing. It's mostly as a reference to myself.

## Components of good practice

I've been a student of Bryan Sutton since 2019. Here are the key messages he's conveyed during our video exchanges: 

* Every practice session should progress through three distinct phases:
    * **Remind**. This can be considered a reminder of good tone and a warm up
    * **Repeat**. Where we might be learning something we know. We could also be reviewing something we already know
    * **Challenge**. Where we seek to challenge our current ability. 
* Deliberate, focussed practice is a good thing. 
* Avoid tension. Be aware of what's going on in your body.
* Variety in practice is a good thing. It's not good to just continually pound the same thing over and over again. Do something for a few minutes and move on.
* Favour musicality over metrics
