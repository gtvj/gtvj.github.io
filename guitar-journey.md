Improving as a guitarist is an important personal goal of mine. Practice is part of my daily routine and I read books, study courses etc. in the pursuit of getting better. 

<blockquote>
The most crucial ingredient for success in music is what happens in the practice room

I started this page at the end of 2020 as a page is a place to record some of the more important things I've learned. It's intended to be a reference to myself.    

## Components of quality practice

I've been a student on [Bryan Sutton's ArtistWorks school](https://artistworks.com/guitar-lessons-bryan-sutton) since 2019. Here are the key messages he's conveyed during our video exchanges: 

* Every practice session should progress through three distinct phases:
    * **Remind**. This can be considered a reminder of what quality is and a warm up;
    * **Repeat**. Where we might be learning something we know. We could also be reviewing something we already know;
    * **Challenge**. Where we seek to challenge our current ability. 
* **Deliberate, focussed practice** is a good thing. Understand what success is and work towards that.
* **Avoid tension**. Be aware of what's going on in your body.
* **Variety** in practice is a good thing. It's not good to just continually pound the same thing over and over again. Do something for a few minutes and move on.
* Favour **musicality over metrics**. The bigger musical ideal is not about aiming for a specific tempo or version. It's more about experiencing the tune in the most musical way possible.

There's a mentality in playing where we're trying to avoid mistakes that, in and of itself, is concerning because it sort of invites a little bit of tension.

## Theory tidbits

Playing the major scale in thirds. 

<blockquote>
<p>While playing the thirds you may notice that some of the thirds are one half step lower than others. For example, in the G major scale, G and B (G-A-B) are two whole steps apart while A and C (A-B-C) are only one and a half steps apart. In music, the distance from G to B is major, while the distance from A to C is minor, which is why the same intervals are called major and minor thirds.</p>
<p>When you play the major scale in thirds, notice that three of the scale degrees have major thirds, while four of them have minor thirds. Specifically, the formula is major-minor-minor-major-minor-minor. <mark>They each have what's called a <strong>perfect 5th</strong>, except for the last one which has a flat 5th</mark></p>

I was initially very confused by the last sentence in this quote. I eventually got to understand it as follows. 

A perfect 5th is 3Â½ steps from a given note. This last sentence is essentially saying that, when playing the major scale in thirds every position will have a perfect 5th except for the last one. This last one has a flat 5th because the 5th is 3 steps from the note. This is probably easier to visualise than I'm making it sound.
