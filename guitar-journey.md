This is a place where I record the things I'm learning about guitar playing. It's mostly as a reference to myself.

## Components of good practice

I've been a student on [Bryan Sutton's ArtistWorks school](https://artistworks.com/guitar-lessons-bryan-sutton) since 2019. Here are the key messages he's conveyed during our video exchanges: 

* Every practice session should progress through three distinct phases:
    * **Remind**. This can be considered a reminder of what quality is and a warm up;
    * **Repeat**. Where we might be learning something we know. We could also be reviewing something we already know;
    * **Challenge**. Where we seek to challenge our current ability. 
* **Deliberate, focussed practice** is a good thing. Understand what success is and work towards that.
* **Avoid tension**. Be aware of what's going on in your body.
* **Variety** in practice is a good thing. It's not good to just continually pound the same thing over and over again. Do something for a few minutes and move on.
* Favour **musicality over metrics**. The bigger musical ideal is not about aiming for a specific tempo or version. It's more about experiencing the tune in the most musical way possible.

<blockquote>
There's a mentality in playing where we're trying to avoid mistakes that, in and of itself, is concerning because it sort of invites a little bit of tension.
