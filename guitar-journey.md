Improving as a guitarist is an important personal goal of mine. Practice is part of my daily routine and I read books, study courses etc. in the pursuit of getting better.

I started this section of the site at the end of 2020 as a page is a place to record some of the more important things I've learned. It's intended to be a reference to myself.
