# Objectives for 2021

At the outset of 2021 I'm not entirely clear what my big picture aims are. This page will be added to as the year progresses.

## Health and wellbeing

I'd like to improve my running fitness and performance in 2021. 

**Current objectives**:

* Train for and run a 5K race

## Professional development

**Current objectives**:

Very broadly, I'd like to be a better lead developer at the end of 2021 than I am at the start. The term 'better' in this context means being more capable of delivering user value effectively and efficiently, and to comminicate the 'why' and 'how' of doing so to others.

* Review and map out WCAG 2.1

## Guitar

Having exceeded 300 hours of practice in 2020 my plan for 2021 is to ensure that my practice sessions are of high-quality and incorporate the [principles of good practice](/guitar-journey#components-of-good-practice). 

One rule I have for 2021 is that only deliberate, focussed practice is recorded as practice time. It's fine to play something I know while watching, say, YouTube, but this can't be recorded towards my daily practice time.

**Current objectives**:

* Learn I am a Pilgrim and submit as a Video Exchange
* Learn Gentle Genius (from Essentials: Soul Rhythm Guitar)

        <dt><a href="https://truefire.com/techniques-guitar-lessons/caged-commander/">CAGED Commander</a> course on Truefire</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>My goal for this course was to improve my fretboard knowledge. I've learned all exercises but skipped sections where specific guitar solos are taught.</p> 
            <p>Completing this course significantly expanded on my knowledge of the CAGED system. New knowledge includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>all five arpeggio shapes and associated framing and trill exercises</li>
                    <li>all C Major double stops</li>
                    <li>a sense of the 1-3-5 relationships within the arpeggio shapes</li>
                    <li>diatonic third interval shapes up the neck (In C Major, these are: CE, DF, EG, FA, GB, AC and BD)</li>
                    <li>diatonic sixth shapes up the neck (In C Major, these are: CA, DB, EC, FD, GE, AF and BG)</li>
                    <li>connecting the shapes using the 'half-step whole' or 'whole-step half' approach</li>
                </ul>
