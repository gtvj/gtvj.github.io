# Objectives for 2021

At the outset of 2021 I'm not entirely clear what my big picture aims are. 

## Health and wellbeing

I'd like to improve my running fitness and performance in 2021. 

**Current objectives**:

* Train for and run a 5K race

## Professional development

**Current objectives**:

Very broadly, I'd like to be a better lead developer at the end of 2021 than I am at the start. The term 'better' in this context means being more capable of delivering user value effectively and efficiently, and to comminicate the 'why' and 'how' of doing so to others.

* Review and map out WCAG 2.1

## Guitar

Having exceeded 300 hours of practice in 2020 my plan for 2021 is to ensure that my practice sessions are of high-quality and incorporate the [principles of good practice](/guitar-journey#components-of-good-practice)

**Current objectives**:

* Learn I am a Pilgrim and submit as a Video Exchange
* Work through CAGED Commander course on Truefire
* Work through Guitar Lab Fretboard Visualization Vol. 1 on Truefire
