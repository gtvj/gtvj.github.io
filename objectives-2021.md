At the outset of 2021 I'm not entirely clear what my big picture aims are. This page will be added to as the year progresses.

## Health and wellbeing

I'd like to improve my running fitness and performance in 2021. 

**Current objectives**:

* Train for and run a 5K race

## Professional development

**Current objectives**:

Very broadly, I'd like to be a better lead developer at the end of 2021 than I am at the start. The term 'better' in this context means being more capable of delivering user value effectively and efficiently, and to comminicate the 'why' and 'how' of doing so to others.

* Learn Wagtail CMS (by completing a relevant course)
* Review and map out WCAG 2.1

## Guitar

Having exceeded 300 hours of practice in 2020 my plan for 2021 is to ensure that my practice sessions are of high-quality and incorporate the [principles of good practice](/2021/01/01/components-of-good-practice.html). 

One rule I have for 2021 is that only deliberate, focussed practice is recorded as practice time. It's fine to play something I know while watching, say, YouTube, but this can't be recorded towards my daily practice time.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

**Current objectives**:

* Learn I am a Pilgrim and submit as a Video Exchange
* Firmly ingrain the CAGED system major shapes, arpeggios and double-stops
* Learn the CAGED system _minor_ shapes and arpeggios.

        <dt><a href="https://truefire.com/guitar-lessons/nashville-number-system-decoded/c952">Nashville Number System Decoded</a> (TrueFire course)</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This is a good course which complimented my recent study of the CAGED system. The number system is really quite straightforward. Specific takeaways were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most of the time you can <strong>work out the key a song</strong> is in by determining whether which diatonic key shares the chords. Search the web for 'Diatonic chord chart' to help with this. For example, if the song has the chords A Maj, B min and C# min then it's in G.  </li>
                <li>The <strong>'1-4-5 zig zag (or bolt)'</strong> will allow you to easily find the 1, 4 and 5 notes which are both above and below a given root note on the 6th or 5th string.</li>
                <li>The <strong>relative major and minor</strong> share the same notes. For example, C Major and A minor share the same notes. This means that you might not need to think about minor keys and can instead think about everything in the major key.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://truefire.com/essentials-guitar-lessons/chord-tone-soloing/c1157">Jeff McErlain's Essentials: Chord Tone Soloing</a> (TrueFire Course)</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>I chose this course because I'm interested to know how to play over chord changes. After about a third of the course I realised that composing solos just isn't something I'm interested in doing at this time. I watched the final two thirds but didn't really engage with the exercises.</p>
                
<p>The key lesson, for me at this stage in my playing, was to focus on 'strong notes' at the right time. These will be chord tones which might not appear in the of the overall scale that's being used to play over the progression. Getting the timing right helps emphasise the movement to the new chord.</p>
            <p>Nothing at all wrong with this course. Just not the right time for it.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Learn Gentle Genius</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This is a nice chord progression played in the style of Curtis Mayfield (with lots of interesting fills etc.). It is very similar sounding to People Get Ready.</p>

        <dd>
            <p>This course was a continuation of my work to improve my fretboard knowledge. Completing this course added to my knowledge of the CAGED system by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Improving my understanding of the triad shapes within the CAGED system</li>
                <li>Introducing me to the minor triad shapes and inversions</li>
                <li>Introducing me to the structure of augmented and diminished triads</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://truefire.com/techniques-guitar-lessons/caged-commander/">CAGED Commander</a> course on Truefire</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>My goal for this course was to improve my fretboard knowledge. I've learned all exercises but skipped sections where specific guitar solos are taught.</p> 
            <p>Completing this course significantly expanded on my knowledge of the CAGED system. New knowledge includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>all five arpeggio shapes and associated framing and trill exercises</li>
                    <li>all C Major double stops</li>
                    <li>a sense of the 1-3-5 relationships within the arpeggio shapes</li>
                    <li>diatonic third interval shapes up the neck (In C Major, these are: CE, DF, EG, FA, GB, AC and BD)</li>
                    <li>diatonic sixth shapes up the neck (In C Major, these are: CA, DB, EC, FD, GE, AF and BG)</li>
                    <li>connecting the shapes using the 'half-step whole' or 'whole-step half' approach</li>
                </ul>
