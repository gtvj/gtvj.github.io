This page lists: my big picture **goals** for the year; what I'm **currently doing** towards them, and what I've **done** so far.

## Health and wellness

I'd like to improve my running fitness and performance in 2021.

**Current objectives**:

* Train for a 10K race

        <summary><strong>Race completed: </strong>The Spring Virtual 5K</summary>
        <p>Having followed an 11 week Garmin Coach adaptive plan I completed this on 27 March. It wasn't my fastest 5K (and was actually 2:45 off my best time from 2017). That said I <strong>did come in 32 seconds under my goal time.</strong></p>
        <p>I'm going to follow the advice now and just run easy for a couple of weeks while I identify my next goal.</p>

## Professional development

Very broadly, I'd like to be a better lead developer at the end of 2021 than I am at the start. I'm defining 'better' in
this context to mean being more capable of delivering user value effectively and efficiently, and to communicate the '
why' and 'how' of doing so to others. My two areas of focus are:

* the new stack we'll be using at work (both front end and back end)
* broader professional and personal effectiveness skills

**Current objectives**:

* Prepare CSS signpost materials (for new developers)
* Produce user-friendly guide to explain WCAG 2.1 Level AA and how to test for compliance

        <summary><strong>Book read:</strong> <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/books/effortless/">Effortless: Make it Easier to Do What Matters Most</a></summary>
        <p>Good book. Lots of ideas that resonated but I expect I'll get more from it on a second pass.</p>

        <p>Having done a bit of research I decided to use this course to structure my learning because it has beginner, intermediate, and advanced modules. Really good course.</p>

        <summary><strong>Book read:</strong> Read <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/indistractable/">Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life</a> by Nir Eyal</summary>
        <p>This was good book which echoes much of what I'd read in Atomic Habits and Essentialism. I'd already done a LinkedIn Learaning course by the author (some time ago) so had adopted some of his recommendations already, but I got more from the book. I especially liked the advice relating to parenting.</p>

        <p>I got this book because I'm always trying to get better at learning. It containss lots of good practical advice.</p>
        <p>The key takeaways for me were:</p>
        <ul class="idea">
            <li><strong>Retrieval practice is very effective</strong>. Re-reading is not. The effort of retrieving knowledge strengthens its staying power.</li>
            <li><strong>When learning feels difficult it can be most effective</strong>. When learning feels easy it is unlikely to last.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed practice is good</strong>. Repeating the same thing again and again is not.</li>
            <li><strong>Interleved practice is good</strong>. Perfecting something before moving on is not.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaced practice is good</strong>. Cramming is not.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of this is <em>hugely</em> valuable.</p>

        <summary><strong>Book read:</strong> <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear</summary>
        <p>Another good book with a lot of great advice. I just feel a little sorry for it because I read it straight after Essentialism (which is a tough act to follow). Nonethelesss - there are a lot of great ideas here and I'll be re-reading it for sure. Two especially impactful/resonant ideas were: the difference between being "in motion" and "taking action", and; The lesson about not being able to choose if you're an egg or a potatoe (that'll make sense if you get the book).</p>
        <p><strong>Update:</strong> I re-read this book shortly afterwards and don't feel I'd really done it justice with the first reading. I got a lot more from it on second reading. It's an excellent book.</p>

        <summary><strong>Course completed:</strong> <a href="https://learnwagtail.com/wagtail-for-beginners/">Wagtail for Beginners</a> (Course)</summary>
        <p>This course is designed for developers who are new to Wagtail CMS. It's given me a reasonably solid grounding in Wagtail concepts and provided the basis for further research into specific areas.</p>

        <summary><strong>Book read:</strong> <a href="https://gregmckeown.com/books/essentialism/">Esssentialism</a> by Greg McKeown</summary>
        <p>This is the best book about personal effectiveness I've read in the last decade. </p>
        <p>In my opinion it's right up there with the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey and Getting Things Done by David Allen. Essentialism has profoundly impacted how I think about work (and life). I can't recommend it highly enough üòç</p>
        <p><strong>Update:</strong> having now re-read Essentialism I still think it's great.</p>

## Guitar

Having exceeded 300 hours of practice in 2020 my plan for this year is to ensure that my practice sessions are of
high-quality and incorporate the [principles of good practice](/2021/01/01/components-of-good-practice.html).

One rule I have for 2021 is that **only deliberate, focussed practice is recorded as practice time**. It's fine to play
something I know while watching but this can't be recorded towards my daily practice time.

<blockquote>
The most crucial ingredient for success in music is what happens in the practice room
<cite>William Westney</cite>
</blockquote>

**Current objectives**:

* Find some inspiration and motivation. Been feeling quite flat recently and practice is feeling like a chore.

        <p>Blasted through this course. Most useful insight: think about separation between your loops (one in the high register, one in low etc. and use the guitar switching to support this, where appropriate)</p>

        <p>Great course and I've now got a grounding in the modes. I know what the modes are, how to identify them, the relevant fingerings and arpeggios. It'll take me a lifetime to master but I'm able to now jump straight in to improvising, say, a C# phryigian progression and play over it. That's a big jump for me.</p>

        <p>Part 2 of this series. Pretty good. I feel more able to recognise chord progressions but still got some of the examples wrong (only a very small proportion though - less than one in ten).</p>

        <p>Good introductory course. A lot of the material I was already familiar with but a couple of things were either new or I'd forgotten:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use the chords in a progression to work out the 'theoretical' key. For example, if you've got two major chords a whole step apart, they must be the IV and V of a scale</li>
            <li>There is the 'street' key for a song and the 'theoretical' key for a song. For example, if you're playing a song with two chords - say, C Major and D Major, you might use the 'street' key to tell other musicians what key it's in (for example, "Let's play blah in C") but you'd need to know the theoretical key to know which scale the solo should be in (which, in this case, would be whatever scales has C and D as the IV and V)</li>

        <summary><strong>Milestone:</strong> Solid understanding of the CAGED system (both major and minor)</summary>
        <p>I've developed a good working knowledge of the CAGED system. I can play:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The major shapes, arpeggios, scale forms (both major and pentatonic)</li>
            <li>The minor shapes and arpeggios</li>
        </ul>

        <summary><strong>Course:</strong> <a href="https://truefire.com/guitar-lessons/nashville-number-system-decoded/c952">Nashville Number System Decoded</a> (TrueFire course)</summary>
        <p>This is a good course which complimented my recent study of the CAGED system. The number system is really quite straightforward. Specific takeaways were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most of the time you can <strong>work out the key a song</strong> is in by determining whether which diatonic key shares the chords. Search the web for 'Diatonic chord chart' to help with this. For example, if the song has the chords A Maj, B min and C# min then it's in G.  </li>
            <li>The <strong>'1-4-5 zig zag (or bolt)'</strong> will allow you to easily find the 1, 4 and 5 notes which are both above and below a given root note on the 6th or 5th string.</li>
            <li>The <strong>relative major and minor</strong> share the same notes. For example, C Major and A minor share the same notes. This means that you might not need to think about minor keys and can instead think about everything in the major key.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary><strong>Course:</strong> <a href="https://truefire.com/essentials-guitar-lessons/chord-tone-soloing/c1157">Jeff McErlain's Essentials: Chord Tone Soloing</a> (TrueFire Course)</summary>
        <p>I chose this course because I'm interested to know how to play over chord changes. After about a third of the course I realised that composing solos just isn't something I'm interested in doing at this time. I watched the final two thirds but didn't really engage with the exercises.</p>
        <p>The key lesson, for me at this stage in my playing, was to focus on 'strong notes' at the right time. These will be chord tones which might not appear in the of the overall scale that's being used to play over the progression. Getting the timing right helps emphasise the movement to the new chord.</p>
        <p>Nothing at all wrong with this course. Just not the right time for it.</p>

        <summary><strong>Progression learned:</strong> Learn Gentle Genius</summary>
        <p>This is a nice chord progression played in the style of Curtis Mayfield (with lots of interesting fills etc.). It is very similar sounding to People Get Ready.</p>

        <summary><strong>Course:</strong> <a href="https://truefire.com/theory-guitar-lessons/chord-navigator-caged-triads/c1011">Chord navigator: CAGED triads</a> on Truefire</summary>
        <p>This course was a continuation of my work to improve my fretboard knowledge. Completing this course added to my knowledge of the CAGED system by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving my understanding of the triad shapes within the CAGED system</li>
            <li>Introducing me to the minor triad shapes and inversions</li>
            <li>Introducing me to the structure of augmented and diminished triads</li>
        </ul>

        <summary><strong>Course:</strong> <a href="https://truefire.com/techniques-guitar-lessons/caged-commander/">CAGED Commander</a> course on Truefire</summary>
        <p>My goal for this course was to improve my fretboard knowledge. I've learned all exercises but skipped sections where specific guitar solos are taught.</p> 
        <p>Completing this course significantly expanded on my knowledge of the CAGED system. New knowledge includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>all five arpeggio shapes and associated framing and trill exercises</li>
            <li>all C Major double stops</li>
            <li>a sense of the 1-3-5 relationships within the arpeggio shapes</li>
            <li>diatonic third interval shapes up the neck (In C Major, these are: CE, DF, EG, FA, GB, AC and BD)</li>
            <li>diatonic sixth shapes up the neck (In C Major, these are: CA, DB, EC, FD, GE, AF and BG)</li>
            <li>connecting the shapes using the 'half-step whole' or 'whole-step half' approach</li>
        </ul>
