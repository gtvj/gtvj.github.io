## Running Jekyll locally

This is a Jekyll site that is hosted on GitHub at [https:gtvj.github.io](https:gtvj.github.io) Use `jekyll build && jekyll serve` to run locally (**Note:** This will also compile SASS so there is no need for a separate build task to achieve this). See the docs for more information.
